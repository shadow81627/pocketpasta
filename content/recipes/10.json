    "3 and 1/4 cups (420g) bread flour (spoon & leveled), plus more for hands and pan",

The dough will seem dry and shaggy, but keep working it until all the flour is moistened. If needed, use your hands (as I do in the video tutorial above) to work the dough ingredients together. The dough will be sticky. Shape into a ball in the bowl as best you can."

The dough will just about double in size, stick to the sides of the bowl, and have a lot of air bubbles."

      "text": "You can continue with step 4 immediately, but for absolute best flavor and texture, I strongly recommend letting this risen dough rest in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours and up to 3 days. Place covered dough in the refrigerator for 12 hours – 3 days. I usually let it rest in the refrigerator for about 18 hours. The dough will puff up during this time, but may begin to deflate after 2 days. That’s fine and normal– nothing to worry about."

Using a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut dough in half. Some air bubbles will deflate as you work with it. Place dough halves on prepared baking sheet. Using floured hands, shape into 2 long loaves about 9×3 inches each (doesn’t have to be exact) about 3 inches apart. Loosely cover and allow to rest for 45 minutes. You will bake the dough on this prepared baking sheet. See recipe note if you want to use a pizza stone."

Carefully and quickly pour 3-4 cups of boiling water into it. Place the scored dough/baking pan on a higher rack and quickly shut the oven, trapping the steam inside.

Yet this simple bread recipe, which is so much easier than sourdough or other complex loaves I've attempted, is always the most popular with my boyfriend! He says it's \"the best bread [he's] had in [his] entire life\". I've had some fun with it-- made it once with rosemary and garlic, and one time I sprinkled everything bagel seasoning on top, which I loved. But he seems to just like it best plain white served with some olive oil and salt/pepper :-) I will say, you're right about the salt. I made the mistake of making it with table salt before buying coarse salt, and it made a WORLD of difference. Thank you for this website <3",
